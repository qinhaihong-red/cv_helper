## Introduction

This is a collection of miscellaneous function wrappers for OpenCV. 

Some handy tools are as below:

- Load image from an environment variable


- A simple time-span recorder


- Apply histogram equalization for color image


- Calculate the __psd(power spectrum density)__ of a __dft(Discrete Fourier Transformation)__


- Calculate the shift after a dft, like __*np.fft.fftshift*__


- Apply filter operation in frequency domain and inverse tranform to spatial domain


- Some macros for readable matrices display
